<h2><a name="signals">Interrupts &amp; Signals</a></h2>
<p><img src="ups.jpg" alt="Uninterruptible power supply (UPS)" style="float:right;width:200px;margin-left:20px;" /><strong>Motivating Example:</strong> The computer is connected via USB to an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). How should the kernel deal with running out of power?</p><!-- original image source: http://www.kevinscrate.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/ups.jpg -->

<p><strong>One solution:</strong> Take a snapshot of RAM, CPU registers and copy them to the disk. Then, shut off power. When power comes back on, reverse the process and restore everything as if the programs never noticed the power interruption.</p>
<h4>What's wrong with this?</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Open network connections will be lost</li>
    <li>Takes too long</li>
    <li>Hard to capture a consistent snapshot</li>
    <li>Time-sensitive operations will be lost</li>
    <li>Has security issues</li>
</ul>

<h4>How to inform user processes of the situation</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Polling</strong><br />
        Use a file <code>/dev/power</code>. Read from it. If the file reads "!", power is low. If it reads " " (a space) power is OK.</p>
        <p>For every program that cares about power, and every loop that might execute for more than a few seconds, insert a check for <code>/dev/power</code>. This is not a satisfactory solution. It's a pain to program, and will chew up CPU time.</p>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Signals</strong><br />
        With signals, the kernel "magically" inserts a check into the program when the power gets low. A signal handler receives the signal from the kernel and takes the necessary steps to fix the situation.</p>
</ol>
<h3>Motivations for Signals</h3>
<p>
<strong>Example:</strong> Press <kbd>^C</kbd> into a terminal to abort a process (this one takes a bunch of zeroes and throws them away).</p>
<pre>
$ cat /dev/zero > /dev/null
^C
$</pre>
<p>The terminal driver informs the operating system of the <kbd>^C</kbd>. The operating system sends <code>SIGINT</code> to all processes with this terminal as the <em>controlling terminal</em>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Uncooperative processes: <code>SIGINT</code></li>
    <li>Broken processes: <code>SIGILL</code>. An "illegal" instruction.</li>
    <li>Invalid addresses: <code>SIGSEGV, SIGBUS</code></li>
    <li>I/O errors and situations: <code>SIGPIPE, SIGIO</code></li>
    <li>A child died <code>SIGCHLD</code></li>
    <li>User signals (for applications): <code>SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2</code>. To send signals to another process, use <code>int <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Signaling-Another-Process.html#Signaling-Another-Process">kill</a> (pid_t pid, int signum)</code>.</li>
    <li>Controlling terminal: <code>SIGSTOP, SIGSTP</code></li>
    <li>Killing a process: <code>SIGKILL</code>. The process <em>will</em> die; it cannot protect itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>Signal handling is a bit of a mess. They should only be used when other means of communication fail.</p>

<h3>Signals vs. Other means of communication</h3>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Using the kill command (<code>kill -USR1 391</code>) vs. sending a message with a pipe (<code>echo x | ...</code>) to end a process.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Processes tend to treat signals with higher priority and are less likely to ignore them</li>
    <li>Signals are ad hoc</li>
    <li>They can be dangerous to use</li>
</ul>

<h3>Signals change how our abstract machine works</h3>
<p>When a signal arrives to a process, it acts as if it inserts an asnchronous function call between any pair of instructions. <em><b style="color:red">TO DO:</b> Picture?</em></p>
<p>This following is an example of a signal handler. When the process receives the <code>SIGINT</code> signal, it prints "ouch!" and exits. Programs don't neccessarily have to define a signal handler. The default action associated with <code>SIGINT</code> is to exit.</p>
<p class="m1"><strong>Signal handler 1:</strong></p>
<pre>
#include &lt;signal.h&gt;

/* defines a new signal handler,
   returning the old one if any */
signal(SIGINT, handle_int); 

void handle_int(int signal)
{
    printf("ouch!\n");
    exit(1);
}</pre>
<p>This signal handler has some potential issues. Internally, <code>printf()</code> (part of the stdio library) maintains output buffers. This means that it calls <code>malloc()</code> to allocate memory in the heap. If this signal arrives during a normal call to <code>malloc()</code> in the normal application code, there is a possibility that the signal handler's call to <code>malloc()</code> from <code>printf("ouch!\n")</code> can corrupt the heap and crash the program. Remember, signals can arrive between any pair of instructions!</p>
<p>To illustrate this, let us imagine that our heap is a simple array, and <code>malloc()</code> is implemented as follows.</p>
<pre style="margin: 0 0 20px 30px;float: left;">
char h[1000000]; // heap
char *hp; // heap pointer
char *hl; // heap limit
 ____________ ____________________
| used space |     free space     |
|____________|____________________| 
^h           ^hp                  ^hl
</pre>
<pre style="margin: 0 0 20px 20px; float: left;" >
inline void *malloc (size_t s)
{
    char *r = hp;
        // what if SIGINT arrives here?
    hp = hp + s;
    return r;
}
</pre>

<p style="clear: both;">Suppose we have an ordinary <code>malloc()</code> call in our application, and then a <code>SIGINT</code> signal immediately arrives after the <code>char *r</code> declaration within <code>malloc()</code>. The signal handler will issue a call to <code>printf()</code>, which in turn also calls <code>malloc()</code>. This call will allocate space at the same <code>hp</code> value, because the previous call to <code>malloc()</code> did not increment the heap pointer yet. If the signal returns, the original call to <code>malloc()</code> no longer has a valid heap pointer.</p>

<p>This means our signal handler must limit to asyncrhonous signal-safe functions. This even excludes our call to <code>exit()</code>, because it flushes all output buffers before exiting the process. To account for these possible issues, we must rewrite our original handler as follows, using the <code>write()</code> and <code>_exit()</code> system calls instead.</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;signal.h&gt;

signal(SIGINT, handle_int);

void handle_int(int signal)
{
    write(STD_ERR_FILENO, "ouch!\n", 6);
    _exit(1);
}</pre>

<h3>Blocking signals</h3>
<p><b style="color: red">TO DO</b></p>

<pre>sigprocmask()</pre>

<p>Why doesn't <code>malloc()</code> block signals?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Overhead of issuing a system call. <code>malloc()</code> needs to be fast.</li>
    <li>Up to the programmer to insure</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="threads">Threads</a></h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h4>Compared with Processes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Like processes, threads share memory, file descripters, and more (i.e. uid, pid, etc.)</li>
            <li>Unlike processes, threads have their own instruction pointer, registers, and stack</li>
            <li>Pro: Threads help break down programs into smaller (and simpler) pieces</li>
            <li>Con: Threads are prone to synchronization issues, both in performance and correctness</li>
         </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Important System Calls</h4>
        <pre>
int pthread_create (pthread_t *thread,          // Identifies the thread.
                    const pthread_attr_t *attr, // Options for making the thread.
                    void *(*fn)(void *),        // The thread executes this function...
                    void *arg);                 // ...given this argument.
        </pre>
        This function creates a new thread. It is similar to the <code>fork</code> function for processes but the new thread begins in a different fuction. If successful, <code>pthread_create</code> returns 0. If unsucessful, it returns an error number.
        <pre>
int ptrhead_join (pthread_t id,    // Identifies the thread.
                  void *status);   // Stores the return value of the thread.
        </pre>
        This function joins the calling thread with the thread given in the argument. It&rsquo;s similar to the <code>wait</code> function for processes. If the thread is still running, then the caller waits for the thread to terminate. If successful, <code>pthread_join</code> returns 0 to the caller. If unsuccessful, it returns an error number.
        <pre>int pthread_exit (void *status);   // Exits the thread returning &rsquo;status&rsquo;</pre>
        This function exits the calling thread with a status of &rsquo;status&rsquo;. It is similar to the <code>exit</code> function for processes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Things a Thread Can Do</h4>
		  <ul>
		      <li>Perform computation</li>
				<li>
				Busy wait: continually check for some condition. This consumes CPU cycles, but it continues as soon as the condition is met.
				<pre>while (device_is_busy ()) continue; </pre>
				</li>
				<li>
				Yield: transfer control to another thread, and return here later. This consumes less CPU cycles than the busy wait, but it increases the device latency
				<pre>while (device_is_busy ()) pthread_yield ();</pre>
				</li>
				<li>Block: yield and tell OS "I am waiting for device x." OS will not wake thread until device is ready.</li>
		  </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Types of Multithreading</h4>
		  <p>
		  <h5>Cooperative Multithreading</h5>
		  In this model, the thread decides when to give up the CPU. In order for this method to work, threads should yield every now and again to allow other threads to continue processing. If a thread forgets to yield, then there is a bug in the program. This method is simple and avoids many data races,but it opens the door for many &rdquo;forget to yield&rdquo; bugs.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  <h5>Preemptive Multithreading</h5>
		  In this model, the scheduling of threads is handled by the operating system. Linux uses this model of multithreading. An example of this strategy would be running each thread 10 miliseconds at a time. With this method, there is no &rdquo;forget to yield&rdquo; bug, but the performance is less predictable, because a thread-switch can occur anywhere.
		  </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Multithreading and Signals</h4>
		  When a multithreaded process receives a signal, the kernel chooses a thread which isn't blocking the signal, and sends it there. You cannot control which thread will receive the signal, but you can block certain signals on all but one thread. This single thread will then receive all signals.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="scheduling">Scheduling</a></h2>
    <p><em>This is the first of a two-lecture series. See the next week&rsquo;s lecture notes for more discussion of scheduling.</em></p>
    <p>Machines have limited resources (CPU cores, memory, bus bandwidth, etc.). When dealing with CPU cores, the operating system needs a system to decide <strong>who goes first</strong>.</p>
<h3>Policies</h3>
    <p><strong>Policies are the high-level algorithm used by a scheduler.</strong> Since schedulers run so often, good schedulers are fast and have desirable metrics.</p>
    <p>Many of the metrics we use today are from automobile production. The graphic below illustrates some of the common metrics used if one factory receives an order for Model T&rsquo;s and Model A&rsquo;s.</p>
    <h4 class="m0 center">Automobile Manufacturing Metrics</h4>
    <p class="center"><embed src="scheduling-graphic.svg" type="image/svg+xml" /></p>
    <p>Since car production scheduling and thread/process scheduling are so similar, many of the terms remain unchanged. Some other common time metrics are&hellip;
    <ul>
        <li>Average wait time</li>
        <li>Average response time</li>
        <li>Worst-case response time</li>
        <li>Best-case response time</li>
        <li>Variance in response time</li>
        <li>And more</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Some other general metrics are&hellip;
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Utilization</strong>: The percentage of time is the factory/CPU busy. (Google&rsquo;s data centers had an average utilization of 0.3 in 2011.)</li>
        <li><strong>Throughout</strong>: The rate of useful work getting done.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Sometimes some metrics, especially resource/CPU utilization are kept lower than needed to save capacity for emergencies and non-characteristic system usage.</p>
<h3>Mechanisms</h3>
    <p><strong>Mechanisms are the low-level ways of switching a running thread.</strong> This is analagous to an operating system&rsquo;s methods of switching between processes.</p>
    <p>Each process that has threads has a <strong>thread table</strong>, a table similar to the operating system&rsquo;s process table. Stored in the thread table are a thread&rsquo;s ID, its registers, and more.</p>
    <p>To implement a context switch from thread <code>T</code> to thread <code>U</code>...
    <ol>
        <li>Control must return to the operating system. Either the thread&rsquo;s time slice expires or the application directly calls an operating system interrupt:
            <pre>int 0x80</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Now that the operating system is in control, it must save all of <code>T</code>&rsquo;s registers (saved on the stack during the interrupt instruction) into the thread table.</li>
        <li>By now, <code>T</code>&rsquo;s state is backed up in the thread table so <code>U</code>&rsquo;s state (registers and instruction pointer) should be copied from the thread table to the appropriate place on the stack.</li>
        <li>The operating system calls <code>reti</code> to return the CPU to user mode and continue execution of <code>U</code>.</li>
    </ol>
